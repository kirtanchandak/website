We recently conducted a survey of how Vitess is being used by the community. This blog post summarizes what we learned.

# What our users said - 

> **"Vitess solves an existential threat for services which outgrow a single MySQL database."**

> **"Horizontal sharding helps us scale quickly, and the new generation execution plan, Gen4, enables us to support more SQL queries."**

# Background

The story begins with the Vitess maintainer team wanting to conduct a user survey with community members and engineers using Vitess in production to gain a better understanding of how to improve the project. As an LFX Mentee'24, I worked with the Vitess maintainers to form the questions and create a format for conducting the user survey. We drafted the questions, reviewed them, and developed a final version of the survey. I'm happy to report that we received a number of responses.

# Summary Responses  - 

### 1. How long have you been using Vitess?
First of all, we decided to ask how long our community members have been using Vitess. Interestingly, quite a few people have been using Vitess for more than 3 years.

# Insights

### We asked our users how Vitess has helped their business. We got some interesting answers from different companies.

1. Scalability: Generally, it has scaled the performance of databases by horizontal sharding.
For eg. -
[How Shopify horizontally scaled the backend of an important Rails application.]("https://shopify.engineering/horizontally-scaling-the-rails-backend-of-shop-app-with-vitess")
 
2. Operational Efficiency: Vitess reduced the burden of managing MySQL clusters at scale, especially in distributed environments like Kubernetes.
3. High Availability: Hardware issues do not cause downtime while they are being repaired.
4. High Connections: Vitess is able to manage high connection counts and rates of churn, essential for highly trafficked and concurrent applications.
5. Efficient Online Schema Changes: Online DDL support in Vitess, combined with horizontal sharding, has let users efficiently change their schema, reducing operational workload for faster product iteration.
6. Lowered DevOps Burden: By abstracting away the complexities of sharding and scaling, Vitess empowers teams to concentrate on higher-level development rather than getting bogged down in database management.
7. Flexibility and stability: Vitess has brought stability even to unsharded setups by managing the connection limits and setting the number of concurrent threads so that databases run as smoothly as possible without any performance issues.

### We also asked them what the biggest missing feature in Vitess is. Here is a curated sample of the responses. 

1. Improved Observability: A consistent dashboard for observing the vreplication streams, with controls over schema changes, can give a better overview of operations.
2. Unified Web UI: A single, easy-to-use web interface for all administrative tasks would ease management and enhance usability.
3. Circuit Breaking and Adaptive Concurrency Limits: We need features to prevent clients from being blocked by slow shards, and manage concurrency.
4. More Clear Upgrade Path with LTS Versions: a well-defined upgrade path with LTS versions is important for stability and fewer bugs.
5. Auto Sharding Improvements: More advanced auto-sharding capabilities would be nice, such as in TiDB.
6. Vitess Keyspace History: Add a feature to track and review changes over time to a keyspaceâ€”such as reparents, backups, or scaling events for historical analysis and debugging.

# Conclusion
