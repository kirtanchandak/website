We recently conducted a survey of how Vitess is being used by the community. This blog post summarizes what we learned.

## Background

The story begins with the Vitess maintainer team wanting to conduct a user survey with community members and engineers using Vitess in production to gain a better understanding of how to improve the project. As an LFX Mentee'24, I worked with the Vitess maintainers to form the questions and create a format for conducting the user survey. We drafted the questions, reviewed them, and developed a final version of the survey. I'm happy to report that we received a number of responses.

## Summary Responses  - 

#### 1.How long have you been using Vitess?
First of all, we decided to ask how long our community members have been using Vitess. Interestingly most users have been using Vitess for more than 3 years.
